\section{Introduction \& Preface}

Welcome to this series of lecture notes! The main book that the material comes from is Arora and Barak's \emph{Computational Complexity} book \cite{arora_baraz_computational_complexity}. Some material that is assumed from the reader (and is referenced in \Cref{sec:review}) is from Sipser's \emph{Introduction to the Theory of Computation} book \cite{sipsertheoryofcomp}. We assume that the reader has a reasonable understanding of the following material:
\begin{itemize}
\item \{Regular, Context-free, Turing-decidable, Turing-recognizable\} languages, and their machine counterparts
\item (Un)decidability
\item Reducibility
\item Recursion theorem
\item Time complexity: $\p, \np, \exptime$, and their -complete versions
\item Space complexity: $\pspace, \npspace, \expspace, \logspace, \nlogspace$, and their -complete versions
\end{itemize}
