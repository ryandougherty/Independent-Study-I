\section{Introduction \& Preface}

Welcome to this series of lecture notes! The main book that the material comes from is Arora and Barak's \emph{Computational Complexity} book \cite{arora_baraz_computational_complexity}. Some material that is assumed from the reader (and is referenced in \Cref{sec:review}) is from Sipser's \emph{Introduction to the Theory of Computation} book \cite{sipsertheoryofcomp}. We assume that the reader has a reasonable understanding of the following material:
\begin{itemize}
\item \{Regular, Context-free, Turing-decidable, Turing-recognizable\} languages, and their automata counterparts
\item (Un)decidability
\item Reducibility
\item Recursion theorem
\item Time complexity: $\classnotation{P}, \classnotation{NP}, \classnotation{EXPTIME}$, and the -complete versions
\item Space complexity: $\classnotation{PSPACE}, \classnotation{EXPSPACE}, \classnotation{L}, \classnotation{NL}$, and the -complete versions
\end{itemize}
