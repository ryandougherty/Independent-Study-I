\section{Randomization}

In the previous sections, we have only dealt with (non)-deterministic TMs. However, there are many important classes that relate a TM when using a probability, as we define below:

\begin{definition}
A \emph{probabilistic TM} (PTM) has two transition functions, and at each step we choose, independently with probability $\frac{1}{2}$, to apply one of the two functions. We say that a PTM $M$ halts in $T(n)$ time if $M$ halts on all inputs $x$ within $T(|x|)$ steps, regardless of the choices made during execution.
\end{definition}

We can now define the probabilistic analog of $\P$, which is $\BPP$:
\begin{definition}
A language $L$ is in $\BPTIME(T(n))$ if there exists a PTM $M$ that decides $L$ in time $T(n)$, $M$ halts within $T(|x|)$ steps regardless of choices, and Pr[$M(x) = L(x)] \ge \frac{2}{3}$. We define:
\[
\BPP = \bigcup_{c \ge 0}\BPTIME(n^c)
\]
\end{definition}
