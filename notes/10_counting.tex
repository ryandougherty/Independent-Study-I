\section{Counting Complexity}

We have defined the $\P$ class as the set of languages that are solvable on a deterministic TM in polynomial time. However, we did not actually describe the solution(s) - for example, we only described whether a given 3SAT formula is satisfiable, and not how many satisfying solutions it has. Note that describing solutions is not a decision problem. However, we will make the necessary modifications:
