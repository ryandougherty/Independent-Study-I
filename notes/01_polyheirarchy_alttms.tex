\section{Polynomial Hierarchy, Alternating TMs}

From \Cref{thm:relativizePandNP}, we have a notion of using {\P} and {\NP} with the power of oracle machines. However, we don't have a generalization of a ``hierarchy" of such oracle machines (the theorem only concerns the ``first level"). Therefore, in \cite{originalpolyhierarchypaper}, the notion of a ``polynomial hierarchy" was created. The hierarchy is defined (equivalently) as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item $\Delta_0^\P = \Sigma_0^\text{\P}$ = $\Pi_0^\text{\P} = \text{\P}$,
\item $\Delta_i^\text{\P} = \text{\P}^{\Sigma_{i-1}^\text{\P}}$, 
\item $\Sigma_i^\text{\P} = \text{\NP}^{\Sigma_{i-1}^\text{\P}}$, 
\item $\Pi_i^\text{\P} = \text{\coNP}^{\Sigma_{i-1}^\text{\P}}$.
\end{itemize}

\begin{definition}
The \emph{polynomial hierarchy}, called \PH, is defined to be:
\[
\text{\PH} = \bigcup_{k = 1}^{\infty} \Sigma_k^{\text{\P}}
\]
\end{definition}

For {\PH}, we often call the $i$-th level of {\PH} to be both $\Sigma_i^\text{\P}$ and $\Pi_i^\text{\P}$. A natural inclination, as has been done before with \NP, \PSPACE, \NL, and the like, is to find a complete problem for {\PH}. However, the following theorem shows that this is most likely not the case.

\begin{theorem}
If there is a \PH-complete language, then {\PH} only has a finite number of levels.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Assume there exists a \PH-complete language, and let it be $L$. By definition, $\text{\PH} = \bigcup_{k = 1}^{\infty} \Sigma_k^{\text{\P}}$. Therefore, for some $j$, we have that $L \in \Sigma_j^\P$, and every language in {\PH} is polynomial-time reducible to $L$. However, any language $A$ that is polynomial-time reducible to some language $B \in \Sigma_j^\P$ has that $A \in \Sigma_j^\P$. Therefore, $\PH \subseteq \Sigma_j^\P$.
\end{proof}
